# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 11: January 18, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Finished JS course on Sololearn.

**Thoughts:** Really avoiding the project of FreeCodeCamp like the plague.


### Day 10: January 17, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Zero work done. I was too exhausted from work to do anything.

**Thoughts:** Blank


### Day 9: January 16, 2018

**Today's Progress:** HTML5 is almost done. Now, I have to learn the JS tricks to move forward.

**Thoughts:** HTML-> what is written; CSS-> how it looks; JS-> how it behaves.


### Day 8: January 15, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Another slow day. Focused more on learning than doing. Learnt about carousel and a few JS tricks

**Thoughts:** Doing something before evening helps a lot. Post dinner, it's almost impossible to work.


### Day 7: January 14, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Tribute page finished. On to next project.

**Thoughts:** I narrowed down the work from a carousel to a single image which reduced the work. Will try carousel later.


### Day 6: January 13, 2018

**Today's Progress:** The page is getting built. I should have it ready by tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** Realised how easy it is to forget by skipping one day. Had to search even the basic HTML syntax. 


### Day 5: January 12, 2018

**Today's Progress:** No work today. Bad day.

**Thoughts:** This is bad. As soon as the learning shifted to project, I have slacked. 


### Day 4: January 11, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Almost Zilch. Will try to redeem myself by learning some JS on the side. Did decide on the Tribute Website topic.

**Thoughts:** I should focus on insane productivity till 12 in the afternoon. After that, it's mostly nada for me.


### Day 3: January 10, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Finished jQuery on FreeCodeCamp. Now, moving to first project- Tribute Page

**Thoughts:** Deciding on a person for Tribute is harder than I thought.


### Day 2: January 9, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Completed till half of jQuery in FreeCodeCamp

**Thoughts:** I should try to do it before 6 pm so that I can log it better.


### Day 1: January 8, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Finished CSS and HTML part in Freecodecamp. Moved to jQuery. 

**Thoughts:** I have started at a slow pace which I've to increase to finish more than one project in 100 days

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Link to work:** [Calculator App](http://www.example.com)
